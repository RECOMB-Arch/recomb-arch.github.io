                    A conference for presenting and discussing new ideas in accelerating bioinformatics workloads
                    with the co-design of hardware & software and the use of new computer architectures, including
                    compiler optimizations, APIs, and DSLs that support acceleration platforms. Our goal is to
                    discuss new system designs tailored for bioinformatics. RECOMB-Arch aims to bring together
                    researchers in the bioinformatics, computational biology, and computer architecture communities to
                    strengthen the progress in accelerating bioinformatics analysis (e.g., genome, transcriptome,
                    proteome analysis) with efficient system designs that include hardware acceleration and software
                    systems tailored for new hardware technologies.
